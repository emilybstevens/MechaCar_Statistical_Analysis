## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the data set?</br> 
The variables with the greatest impact on variance in this analysis are ground clearance, vehicle length, and the intercept. </br> 

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be near zero? Why or why not? </br>
Without an actual visualization or a slope analysis on this multi-variable regression, 
it's impossible to say for certain that this linear regression would have a non-zero 
slope. However, it can be assumed (based on the strong correlation between variables and their impact on variance)
that the slope of the regression would not be considered near zero. </br>

- Does this linear model predict MPG of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils 
must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification 
for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
- briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.
